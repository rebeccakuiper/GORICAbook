Kuiper and Leonard Vanbrabant 19 februari 2026 Chapter 1 Types of input The goric function of restriktor takes different forms of input: * enter fitted unconstrained object: - lm, - rlm, - glm, - glmer(Mod), - nlmer(Mod), - lmer(Mod), - CTmeta, - rma, - lavaan; * enter the (structural) parameter estimates (possibly, standardized) and their covariance matrix. Functions that can often be used for extrcation: - coef() &amp; vcov() - fixef() &amp; vcov() Please note that: * The GORIC can only be calculated for lm objects. * The GORIC (type = ‘goric’) is the default for lm objects, while GORICA (type = ‘gorica’) is for the other input options. * In the GORICA, the estimates are assumed to be normally distributed. So, for some models when sample size is low, this assumption may not hold. In that case, it is often not clear how well the GORICA performs. See Altinisik et al 2021, for some simulations regarding logistic regression and SEM models (for which the GORICA performs well). Next, I will generate (regression) data. Afterwards, I will show some example for how one can extract the input needed and evaluate the hypothesis of interest based on that.
